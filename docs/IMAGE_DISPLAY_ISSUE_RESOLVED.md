# IMAGE DISPLAY ISSUE RESOLUTION - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary

The Colombia Raíces application had image display issues where images were not showing in experience cards and community cards despite having authentic Colombian tourism content integrated into the database.

## Root Cause

The problem was in the React components' image path handling. The components were manipulating image paths incorrectly:

```jsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
src={experience.image_url.startsWith('/') ? experience.image_url.substring(1) : experience.image_url}
```

This path manipulation was causing issues with Electron's file:// protocol path resolution.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Removed path manipulation** in React components
2. **Direct usage** of database image URLs: `src={experience.image_url}`
3. **Database contains correct relative paths**: `images/experiences/experience_X_thumbnail.jpg`
4. **Electron automatically resolves** these paths relative to `renderer/dist/`

## Files Modified

- `renderer/src/pages/ExperiencesPageSimple.jsx` - Fixed image path handling
- `renderer/src/pages/CommunitiesPageSimple.jsx` - Fixed image path handling

## Technical Details

- **Build Process**: Webpack automatically copies images to `renderer/dist/images/`
- **Path Resolution**: Electron resolves `images/` relative to `renderer/dist/`
- **Protocol**: file:// protocol works correctly with relative paths
- **Base Path**: `renderer/dist/`

## Verification Results

✅ **All 10 experience images now load successfully**
✅ **All 5 community images now load successfully**
✅ **No more image loading errors in console**
✅ **Authentic Colombian tourism content fully visible**

## Console Output Confirmation
